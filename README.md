# Election Voting Prediction and Visualization

This project explores **voting prediction and pattern interpretation** using machine learning techniques.  
The goal is to analyze voting datasets, build predictive models, and visualize results to identify patterns in electoral data.

## Features
- Data preprocessing of U.S. election dataset.  
- Predictive modeling using machine learning (scikit-learn).  
- Visualization of voting patterns with Matplotlib and Seaborn.  
- Presentation video and project documentation included.  

## Dataset
- **US_dataset.csv**: Contains features used for modeling and prediction.  

## Requirements
Please install the following libraries/modules before running the code:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
